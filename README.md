## Problem Description
The project aims at building a chatbot that can efficiently take user query inputs about the Durham College COVID-19 Awareness Program, and it reciprocates with a standard answer. In action, it is an intent classification problem where the question coming in from the user can be classified with actual “intent” and the chatbot displays the answer corresponding to that intent. It is basically NLP task.
